This report has the objective of present and discuss an analysis of risk factors during pregnancy, 
related to baby weights. To identify insights and predict preventable issues, we studied data of 18 
variables in 196 babies, including basic information of the parents such as age, ethnicity, 
education, drinking, smoking behaviors and gender of baby. The finding indicates the influence 
of mother’s age larger than 54, father’s age, father’s education, consumption of cigarettes and 
alcohol. A predictive model with a score of 0.703 (explaining 70.3% of the variability in risk 
factors influencing babies' weights) emphasizes that mothers aging over 54 years old should be 
aware of the risk in child birth weight and be cautious with drinking and smoking behavior. At 
the end, we make a recommendation to put efforts in data collection and feature gathering, to 
improve preemptive actions based on analytics. A classification model is also suggested to work 
better with predicting abnormality of birthweight.
